# Subtext - LinkedIn Comment Generator

An advanced Chrome extension that generates human-like, contextually relevant LinkedIn comments using Google's Gemini AI and Groq AI. Now with **Profile-Aware Commenting** for personalized, authentic interactions.

## 🚀 New Features

### Profile-Aware Comments
- **Profile Detection**: Extract your LinkedIn profile information to make comments more personalized
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Comments reference your experience, skills, and professional background when relevant
- **Smart Relevance**: Only incorporates profile data when it naturally fits the conversation
- **Privacy Focused**: Profile data is stored locally in your browser and never shared

### Advanced Comment Generation
- **Radical Humanization**: Comments sound genuinely human with natural imperfections
- **Anti-AI Detection**: Sophisticated techniques to avoid generic AI-sounding responses
- **Content Type Detection**: Automatically adapts tone and approach based on post type (advice, story, opinion, etc.)
- **Industry-Specific Language**: Uses appropriate terminology and perspective for your field

## 📋 How It Works

### Setting Up Profile-Aware Comments

1. **Extract Your Profile**:
   - Navigate to your LinkedIn profile page
   - Open the extension popup
   - Click "Extract Profile from Current Page"
   - Your professional information is now stored for personalized comments

2. **Enable Profile-Aware Mode**:
   - Check "Use my LinkedIn profile for personalized comments" in the popup
   - Comments will now incorporate your background when relevant

### Comment Generation Process

1. **Automatic Generation**: Click any comment button on LinkedIn posts and the extension automatically generates a relevant, human-like comment
2. **Profile Integration**: The AI considers your professional background, experience, and expertise when crafting responses
3. **Natural Language**: Comments use authentic language patterns, casual expressions, and industry-appropriate terminology
4. **Context Matching**: Different strategies for advice posts, personal stories, opinion pieces, and general content

## 🎯 Example Improvements

### Before (Generic AI):
> "This resonates! I've found that productivity tips are really valuable. Thanks for sharing!"

### After (Profile-Aware & Human):
> "Yeah, been trying similar approaches since joining the startup world. The Pomodoro thing actually helped during my time at TechCorp when we had those crazy sprint cycles... have you found any specific tools that work better for remote teams?"

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Advanced Features
